# Climate-Data-Clustering-Visualization

I'm using a [Kaggle climate dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) to create visualizations out of clusters. I am particularly interested in Dhaka, Bangledesh because Bangladesh is the most vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, my parents are from there so that's where a lot of my motivation in this project comes from. 

I am creating a Jupyter notebook to show my code, plots, and analysis of these visualizations.
