# Climate-Data-Clustering-Visualization

I'm using a [Kaggle climate dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) to create visualizations out of clusters. I am particularly interested in Dhaka, Bangledesh because Bangladesh is the most vulnerable to climate change.

I am creating a Jupyter notebook to show my code, plots, and analysis of these visualizations.
